# Java examples

You can generate the SDK in [buf](https://buf.build/coscene-io/coscene-openapi/sdks) and use the SDK in your Java
project.

## Java version

Right now, we use Java 17, if you want to use older versions, you may need to downgrade the Java version and the dependencies version in the `build.gradle` file.

## Other examples

You can read the examples in [grpc-java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/examples/README.md).
